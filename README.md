Python for web development
==========

Here I will publish usefull articles **about Python** and web development. I will try to keep this book up-to-date. The main goal of this book is to help Python developers to learn some tricks and deeper understand this powerful and beautiful programming language.

I started to work on Windows more than 10 years ago, then switched to **Ubuntu** to avoid unicode and other problems. After some time I decided to switch to MacOS and use only it for development. I strongly recommend you to use either **Ubuntu** or **MacOS** for web development to make your development life much easier.
