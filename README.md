Python for web development
==========

Here I will publish usefull articles about Python and web development. When I learn something new - I try to create new article or update existing article. The main goal - to help other Python developers to learn some tricks and deeper understand this amazing programming language.

I work on **Mac OS X** and like this OS. But if you use **Ubuntu** - you also can be happy with Python. Who uses **Windows** - I am sorry, but you need to change your OS to something better for development.
