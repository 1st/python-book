# Visual Studio Code

**Visual Studio Code** is a good code editor with support of **Python** and extended features such as code Debuging.
It looks very similar to Sublime Text, works fast and extendable with extensions. Code autocomplition works fine,
allowing to see variable names and function descriptions.
